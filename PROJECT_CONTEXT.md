# FolioZen - Crypto Investment Tracking Project Context

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: FolioZen (Crypto Investment Tracking)
- **Framework**: Symfony 7.x
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Webpack Encore
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL with Doctrine ORM
- **Features**: Asset management, transaction tracking, user authentication, billing

## Recent Issues & Solutions

### 1. Asset Management Route Conflict (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**Problem**: AssetController route `/assets` conflicted with Symfony's asset mapper
**Error**: `Asset with public path "/assets/" not found`
**Solution**: 
- Changed AssetController route from `/assets` to `/my-assets`
- Updated base.html.twig to use direct CSS links instead of Webpack Encore
- All existing template links continue to work (route names unchanged)

### 2. CSS Disappearing Issue (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**Problem**: CSS disappeared after attempting Webpack Encore integration
**Solution**: 
- Restored direct CSS links in base.html.twig: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/app.css">`
- Removed Webpack Encore functions temporarily
- CSS is now working properly

### 3. Node.js/npm Installation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
**Status**: Node.js v24.8.0 and npm v11.6.0 successfully installed
**Method**: Used Windows Package Manager (winget)
**Note**: Webpack Encore setup attempted but had configuration issues

### 4. Missing Privacy Policy Template (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**Problem**: LegalController referenced `legal/privacy.html.twig` but file didn't exist
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive privacy policy template
- Uses `dashboard/layout.html.twig` (consistent with other legal pages)
- Includes GDPR-compliant content with all required sections
